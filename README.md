# NuGenomics AI Assistant 

A smart, modern AI agent for **NuGenomics** powered by the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. This project intelligently handles both **customer support** queries and **genetic wellness** questions, dynamically routing each to the appropriate logic using ADK-native capabilities.

---

##  Project Overview

This AI assistant is designed to:

-  **Handle Support Queries** — Fetches real answers from NuGenomics’ [FAQ page](https://www.nugenomics.in/faqs/) using Google Search.
-  **Handle Wellness Queries** — Answers using AI's built-in understanding of genetics, DNA, fitness, and health.
-  **Dynamic Routing** — Decides which tool or response method to use based on user query, **without hardcoded if-else logic**.

---

##  Components Breakdown

### 1. **Main Agent Logic (`agentsingle.py`)**

- Uses Google ADK's `Agent` class with clear `instruction` to:
  - Use `google_search` for support questions.
  - Answer health/wellness queries directly.
- Tool: `run(query)` is passed as a Tool to the agent.

---

### 2. **Google Search Integration**

- Integrated using ADK’s `google_search` tool.
- Used to extract FAQ answers by querying NuGenomics’ FAQ page (instead of direct scraping).
- Keeps responses up-to-date and accurate.
- Used the browsers web developer tools to see the underlying HTML structure of the page to find the questions in h4 tags and their answers in adjacent div tags

---

### 3. **Asynchronous Session Management**

- Uses `InMemorySessionService` for managing sessions.
- ADK’s `Runner` executes the agent’s response flow.
- Sessions and runners are created **asynchronously** to improve performance and flexibility.

---

### 4. **Flask Backend (`app.py`)**

- ✅ Serves a clean HTML frontend via `/`
- ✅ Provides an API at `/api/query` to accept user input and return agent responses
- ✅ Uses `asyncio` to initialize the agent session and runner

---

### 5. **Frontend (`index.html`)**

-  Simple and clean HTML UI
-  Lets users type a question and receive real-time AI responses

---

### 6. **Testing (`tests/test_agent.py`)**

- ✅ Built with `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`
- ✅ Includes mocks for:
  - Agent session
  - Runner responses
- ✅ Tests:
  - Empty/invalid responses
  - Correct final output parsing
  - Session creation behavior

---

##  How the AI Works

###  Agent Initialization

- API key (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`) loaded from `.env` file
- `Agent` instantiated with:
  - Tool: `run(query)`
  - Model: `gemini-2.0-flash`
  - Clear, role-based instructions for dual-purpose use

###  Session + Runner

```python
session_service = InMemorySessionService()
runner = Runner(agent=nugenomics_agent, ...)
Fixed APP_NAME, USER_ID, and SESSION_ID

Session used to manage interaction history

Agent Message Flow

User submits query

Query converted to types.Content

Runner processes the message

Agent either:

Calls run() tool (for support)

Replies from built-in knowledge (for wellness)

### Testing
Run all tests:

pytest
Features:

Mocked tools and runners

Tests async event flows

Handles edge cases gracefully
